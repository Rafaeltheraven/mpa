# Music Player Album
A series of bash scripts wrapped around `mpc` to facilitate listening to albums.

## Features

* Add a random album to the playlist
* Skip forward to the next album
* Whatever else I can think of that sounds useful

## How to use

`mpa rand` - Adds a random album to the playlist. Use `-c` to clear the playlist beforehand (effectively playing a new album)
`mpa next` - Skip to the next album
